"The 2018 Outside Lands Music Festival. Photo: Amy Osborne, Special to The Chronicle 2018Set in Golden Gate Park, the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival has brought some of the biggest names in music to San Francisco’s most beautiful venue. Among the stars who have performed under the century-old canopy of trees on the Polo Field since the festival started in 2008 are Paul McCartney, Elton John, Neil Young, Janet Jackson and Radiohead."
"Beyond the music — and there’s music everywhere — the festival offers a variety of attractions, from an on-site comedy club, art installations, a section devoted to cannabis connoisseurs, an array of local food vendors, and countless sponsored cabanas offering haircuts, charging stations and other distractions to keep the festival’s 70,000 daily attendees on the move. Just be prepared for when the fog rolls in."
When and where is Outside Lands?
"Now in its 12th year, the festival returns to Golden Gate Park from Friday to Sunday, Aug. 9-11, with six stages spread across the Polo Field, Hellman Hollow and Speedway Meadow. The Barbary tent, which hosts the comedy programming, is located in Marx Meadow."
"The festival gates open at 11 a.m. each day, and the music starts at noon with a strict curfew of 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 9:40 p.m. Sunday."
"Borns plays the Lands End stage during Outside Lands 2018. Photo: Scott Strazzante, The Chronicle 2018Who’s playing Outside Lands 2019?"
"Paul Simon, Childish Gambino and Twenty One Pilots are slated to headline, topping a deliberately eclectic bill that features more than 50 acts, including the Denver folk-rockers the Lumineers, Australian electronic musician Flume, the multiplatinum-selling pop-punk act Blink-182, Norwegian DJ Kygo, Texan R&B singer Leon Bridges and Grammy album-of-the-year winner Kacey Musgraves."
"Other artists scheduled to appear include Lil Wayne, Hozier, RL Grime, Ella Mai, Counting Crows, Flying Lotus, Mavis Staples, Santigold and Bebe Rexha, along with Bay Area acts such as Nahko and Medicine for the People, the California Honeydrops, P-Lo, Still Woozy and Toro y Moi."

"Chill and chilly. Outside Lands is different from other large-scale festivals such as Southern California’s Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival and Lollapalooza in Chicago, not only for its lineups but for its geography. Set in a gorgeous expanse of green amid San Francisco’s cold summer weather, the festival is almost always blanketed with fog before the sun sets. Then the temperature inevitably dips  low enough to leave the T-shirt-wearing masses queuing up for ponchos and blankets as the headliner takes the stage."
How do I get there?
Leave your car at home. Parking in and around the festival is extremely limited — if not impossible — and chances are good the weekend will end with you retrieving it from the impound lot.
"If you can’t walk, take a scooter, ride a bike (your best options) or take public transportation. The  N-Judah Muni Metro and the lines 1-California, 5-Fulton, 7-Haight/Noriega, 28-19th Avenue, 29-Sunset, 31-Balboa, and 38-Geary will get you close enough to the festival site in Golden Gate Park (the box office is in Marx Meadow, accessible from 25th Avenue and Fulton Street)."
"Outside Lands also offers a shuttle service from the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium for those arriving via BART. The cost of the three-day shuttle pass is $49.50, plus fees, and does not include admission to the festival."
Outside Lands 2019: 8 ways to go easy on the environment
"Alex Smolen shows off her Champagne-flavored cotton candy last year at Outside Lands. Photo: Amy Osborne, Special to The Chronicle 2018What are the food and drink options like?"
"One of the main attractions at Outside Lands is the great food on offer as part of the festival’s Taste of the Bay Area program. There will be booths featuring 80 restaurants, 46 wineries, 31 breweries and 6 cocktail bars, nearly all hailing from Northern California."
"This year the festival is expanding its reach to include some new and notable Bay Area pop-ups, including Chef Smelly’s Creole and Soul Food (Dungeness crab fries), Francis Ang’s Filipino pop-up Pinoy Heritage (sisig fried rice, lumpia) and Mexican venture Xolo (carne asada burritos)."
"Joining the newcomers to the festival in 2019 are Michael Mina’s new Trailblazer Tavern (kimchi fried rice), Poke to the Max from James Beard Award winner Sam Choy (rice plates, spam musubi, Korean fried chicken) and Michelin-starred Omakase (sushi)."
"Veteran vendors like Rich Table (porcini doughnuts), the Curry Up Now food truck (tikka masala burritos) and Proposition Chicken (fried chicken sandwiches) are all returning to Golden Gate Park this year too."
"Make sure to schedule in time to visit the specialty areas, including Cheese Lands, Bubble Tea Party and Outside Clams."
"There’s also the GastroMagic stage, which offers freewheeling cooking demonstrations and performances by celebrity chefs, musicians and comedians. New this year, the stage will be co-hosted by Bon Appétit magazine, with Editor in Chief Adam Rapoport plus senior editors and “Test Kitchen” stars Molly Baz and Andy Baraghani serving as emcees for the weekend."
"The GastroMagic lineup includes musicians such as Counting Crows singer Adam Duritz, Ella Mai and Anderson .Paak. They’ll be joined by chefs like Jessica Koslow, Chris Cosentino and Susan Feniger."
"Sunday’s Beignets and Bounce also returns, with rapper Katey Redd taking over for her former dancer, Big Freedia."
Outside Lands 2019: Full lineup of food and drink options
"Michelle Wolf performs at the Barbary stage at last year’s Outside Lands. Photo: Amy Osborne, Special to The Chronicle 2018What’s up with the Barbary comedy tent?"
"The Barbary headliners are stand-up comic Mike Birbiglia, Jimmy O. Yang of HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” and both Dulcé Sloan and Ramy Youssef from “The Daily Show,” but the comedy tent has so much more to offer."
"Others comedians expected to perform include Nore Davis, Rhea Butcher and Bay Area comic Nori Reed; along with performances of “Voyage to the Stars Live!” with Colton Dunn, Felicia Day, Janet Varney and Steve Berg; “Tiny Meat Gang Live” with Cody Ko and Noel Miller; and “Off Book: The Improvised Musical” with Jessica McKenna and Zach Reino and more."
"The stage, which is co-curated by SF Sketchfest, is also expected to host the San Francisco debut of “Who’s The Boss” star Tony Danza’s “Standards & Stories” show."
What happens after the festival?
"Just because the park has a curfew doesn’t mean the music stops. Outside Lands hosts a variety of Night Shows at various venues around San Francisco once the grounds go dark. Among the acts performing this year are the Neighbourhood, Phosphorescent, Cherry Glazerr, Yaeji, Better Oblivion Community Center (the side project of Hardly Strictly Bluegrass veteran Conor Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers), plus many more. Check the listing of night shows on the festival’s official website for full schedule and ticket availability."
Before you go …
"Outside Lands can feel a little overwhelming, so technology is here to help. Download the official Outside Lands mobile app for the latest festival updates, a detailed map of the grounds and a friend-finder function."
"Need to know if you can bring your cat to the festival? The latest clear bag policy? Where to find an ATM? How late the box office is open? Take your questions over to the Outside Lands website, which features a comprehensive information page, as well as other vital information."
"Here’s one answer to get you started: Yes, it will get cold, especially when the sun goes down. Bring layers. Lots of them — in your clear bag, of course."
